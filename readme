This project generates clean label poisons using the concept of feature collisions from the paper : Poison Frogs! Targeted Clean-Label Poisoning
Attacks on Neural Networks paper by Shafahi et.al. We then evaluate the potency of these generated poisons during the test phase and conclude that it has 
no significant effect on the performance of the models. Then we include these poison images in the training set and train the penultimate layer of the VGG-16 
architecture. All the target instances were misclassified during this experiment. Then we performed an end to end training for the VGG 16 and multi resolution 
CNN architectures. 2 of the 5 target instances were misclassified for the VGG- 16 architecture and no instances were misclassified for the multiresolution CNN 
architecture thereby leading us to conclude that multiresolution CNN's are more robust to targeted clean label poisoning attacks.
